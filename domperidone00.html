<h2 class="section_header" id="Justification">Justification</h2>
<p>
    Domperidone is a chemical with a primary use in treating headaches and nausea, as well as increasing stomach 
    and bowel contractions. However, it has a secondary side effect of increasing prolactin levels, that has been
    utilised by cis<sup><a href="#footnote01">1</a></sup> and trans<sup><a href="#footnote02">2</a></sup> women alike in order to induce breast feeding. After tanner 4, our breasts are
    fully developed and able to produce milk. Theoretically, by taking domperidone to signal my breasts to begin
    milk production, the breasts should increase in size as cis women's do.
</p>

<p>
    While cis women's breasts typically deflate after giving birth, this is because prolactin acts as an antagonist
    to the production of estrogen and progesterone, leading to their hormone levels being reduced. As trans women's
    hormones are provided externally, this drop shouldn't occur, and as such the size increase should remain
    permenantly. As the size increase tends to continue in cis women across multiple pregnancies, theorectically
    taking Domperidone could be taken until the desired size is reached, although this seems untested in both trans
    and cis communities alike.
</p>
<p>
    As such the 'Domperidone Diaries' seeks to at least provide an anecdotal case study to explore the benefits for
    myself and other trans women.

<h2 class="section_header"id="Aim">Aim</h2>
<p>
    I aim to post a weekly update on physical and mental symptoms, and any changes to breast size. Once the first post
    is up, you should be able to find it <a href="domperidone01.html">here</a>. Contents of each update may be
    subject to change over time.
</p>
<p>
    I plan on taking domperidone for around 3 months minimum if no changes are observed. I have a vague aim of reaching
    a bust size of 46 from 42, but we will see whether that's a reasonable aim as we go along.
</p>

<h2 class="section_header" id="Routine">Routine</h2>
<p>
    My current hormone routine is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>2x 100mg Evogel patches (Changed 2x per week)</li>
    <li>400mg progesterone (taken rectally daily)</li>
    <li>Triptorelin injection (once every three months)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Starting today this will be supplemented with 30mg of Domperidone, taken as 10mg three times a day. These pills are available on some sites under the names Motillum and Domtom.

<p>
    You can contact me at <a href="mailto:oestrogenicalchemist@proton.me">oestrogenicalchemist@proton.me</a>. I aim to at least check it once a week as I release each update.
