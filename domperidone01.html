<p>I've continued to take 3 a day. If I miss a dose I just take it as soon as I realise.</p>

<p>Day 4: Chest, particulalry nipples start really hurting. Positive sign i hope.</p>
<p>Day 5: Small amount of sticky fluid around my right nipple, unsure if this is a sign of lactation? </p>
<p>Day 6-9: Occassional pain in nipples but otherwise no changes, no more evidence of lactation</p>

<h2 class="section_header" id="Measurements">Measurements</h2>
<p>My bust size measures 42.5 inches, up from 42 inches when I wrote the introduction. While it's hard to tell if this is solely domperidone or would have occured otherwise, it feels like a good sign.</p>
